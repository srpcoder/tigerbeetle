# Quickstart

First, let's get TigerBeetle running!

* [Single-node cluster with a single binary](./single-binary.md)
* [Three-node cluster with a single binary](./single-binary-three.md)

Or, you can run TigerBeetle with Docker:
* [Single-node cluster with Docker](./with-docker.md)
* [Three-node cluster with Docker Compose](./with-docker-compose.md)

Then, let's [use the TigerBeetle CLI](./cli-repl.md) to create accounts and transfers.
