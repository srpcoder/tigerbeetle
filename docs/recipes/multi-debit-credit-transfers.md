# Multi-Debit, Multi-Credit Transfers

TigerBeetle is designed for maximum performance. In order to keep it lean, the database only supports simple transfers with a single debit and a single credit.

However, you'll probably run into cases where you want transactions with multiple debits and/or credits. For example, you might have a transfer where you want to extract fees and/or taxes.

Read on to see how to implement one-to-many and many-to-many transfers!

> Note that all of these examples use the [Linked Transfers flag (`flags.linked`)](../reference/transfers.md#flagslinked) to ensure that all of the transfers succeed or fail together.

## One-to-Many Transfers

Transactions that involve multiple debits and a single credit OR a single debit and multiple credits are relatively straightforward.

You can use multiple linked transfers as depicted below.

### Single Debit, Multiple Credits

This example debits a single account and credits multiple accounts. It uses the following accounts:

- A _source account_ `A`, on the `USD` ledger.
- Three _destination accounts_ `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, on the `USD` ledger.

| Ledger | Debit Account | Credit Account | Amount | `flags.linked` |
| -----: | ------------: | -------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|    USD |           `A` |            `X` |  10000 |           true |
|    USD |           `A` |            `Y` |     50 |           true |
|    USD |           `A` |            `Z` |     10 |          false |

### Multiple Debits, Single Credit

This example debits multiple accounts and credits a single account. It uses the following accounts:

- Three _source accounts_ `A`, `B`, and `C` on the `USD` ledger.
- A _destination account_ `X` on the `USD` ledger.

| Ledger | Debit Account | Credit Account | Amount | `flags.linked` |
| -----: | ------------: | -------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|    USD |           `A` |            `X` |  10000 |           true |
|    USD |           `B` |            `X` |     50 |           true |
|    USD |           `C` |            `X` |     10 |          false |

## Many-to-Many Transfers

Transactions with multiple debits and multiple credits are a bit more involved (but you got this!).

This is where the accounting concept of a Control Account comes in handy. We can use this as an intermediary account, as illustrated below.

In this example, we'll use the following accounts:

- Two _source accounts_ `A` and `B` on the `USD` ledger.
- Three _destination accounts_ `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, on the `USD` ledger.
- A _compound entry control account_ `Control` on the `USD` ledger.

| Ledger | Debit Account | Credit Account | Amount | `flags.linked` |
| -----: | ------------: | -------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|    USD |           `A` |      `Control` |  10000 |           true |
|    USD |           `B` |      `Control` |     50 |           true |
|    USD |     `Control` |            `X` |   9000 |           true |
|    USD |     `Control` |            `Y` |   1000 |           true |
|    USD |     `Control` |            `Z` |     50 |          false |

Here, we use two transfers to debit accounts `A` and `B` and credit the `Control` account, and another three transfers to credit accounts `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.

If you looked closely at this example, you may have noticed that we could have debited `B` and credited `Z` directly because the amounts happened to line up. That is true!

For a little more extreme performance, you _might_ consider implementing logic to circumvent the control account where possible, to reduce the number of transfers to implement a compound journal entry.

However, if you're just getting started, you can avoid premature optimizations (we've all been there!). You may find it easier to program these compound journal entries _always_ using a control account -- and you can then come back to squeeze this performance out later!
