# TigerBeetle Docs

TigerBeetle is a distributed financial accounting database designed
for mission critical safety and performance.

## Quickstart

First, let's get TigerBeetle running!

* [Single-node cluster with a single binary](./quick-start/single-binary.md)
* [Three-node cluster with a single binary](./quick-start/single-binary-three.md)

Or, you can run TigerBeetle with Docker:
* [Single-node cluster with Docker](./quick-start/with-docker.md)
* [Three-node cluster with Docker Compose](./quick-start/with-docker-compose.md)

Then, let's [use the TigerBeetle CLI](./quick-start/cli-repl.md) to create accounts and transfers.

## Designing for TigerBeetle

following:

- [TigerBeetle and consistency](./design/consistency.md)
