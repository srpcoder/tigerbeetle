# Transfers

A `transfer` is an immutable record of a financial transaction between
two accounts.

In TigerBeetle, financial transactions are called "transfers" instead of "transactions" because
the latter term is heavily overloaded in the context of databases.

### Updates

Transfers *cannot be modified* after creation.

## Modes

Transfers can either be Single-Phase, where they are executed immediately, or Two-Phase, where
they are first put in a Pending state and then either Posted or Voided. For more details on the
latter, see the [Two-Phase Transfer guide](../design/two-phase-transfers.md).

Fields used by each mode of transfer:

| Field                         | Single-Phase | Pending  | Post-Pending | Void-Pending |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `id`                          | required     | required | required     | required     |

| `credit_account_id`           | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `amount`                      | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `pending_id`                  | none         | none     | required     | required     |

## Fields

### `id`

This is a unique identifier for the transaction.

As an example, you might generate a [ULID](../design/data-modeling.md#time-based-identifiers) to
identify each transaction.

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* Must not be zero or `2^128 - 1`
* Must not conflict with another transfer

See the [`id` section in the data modeling doc](../design/data-modeling.md#id) for more
recommendations on choosing an ID scheme.

### `debit_account_id`

This refers to the account to debit the transfer's [`amount`](#amount).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are unset:
  * Must match an existing account
  * Must not be the same as `credit_account_id`
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` are set:
  - If `debit_account_id` is zero, it will be automatically set to the pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id`.
  - If `debit_account_id` is nonzero, it must match the corresponding pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id`.

### `credit_account_id`

This refers to the account to credit the transfer's [`amount`](#amount).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are unset:
  * Must match an existing account
  * Must not be the same as `debit_account_id`
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` are set:
  - If `credit_account_id` is zero, it will be automatically set to the pending transfer's
    `credit_account_id`.
  - If `credit_account_id` is nonzero, it must match the corresponding pending transfer's
    `credit_account_id`.

### `amount`

This is how much should be debited from the `debit_account_id` account
and credited to the `credit_account_id` account.

- When `flags.balancing_debit` is set, this is the maximum amount that will be debited/credited,
  where the actual transfer amount is determined by the debit account's constraints.
- When `flags.balancing_credit` is set, this is the maximum amount that will be debited/credited,
  where the actual transfer amount is determined by the credit account's constraints.

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `amount` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `amount`.
  * If `amount` is nonzero, it must be less than or equal to the pending transfer's `amount`.
* When `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `amount` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `amount`.
  * If `amount` is nonzero, it must be equal to the pending transfer's `amount`.
* When `flags.balancing_debit` and/or `flags.balancing_credit` is set, if `amount` is zero,
  it will automatically be set to the maximum amount that does not violate the corresponding
  account limits. (Equivalent to setting `amount = 2^128 - 1`).
* When all of the following flags are not set, `amount` must be nonzero:
  * `flags.post_pending_transfer`
  * `flags.void_pending_transfer`
  * `flags.balancing_debit`
  * `flags.balancing_credit`

#### Examples

- For representing fractional amounts (e.g. `$12.34`), see
  [Fractional Amounts](../recipes/fractional-amounts.md).
- For balancing transfers, see [Close Account](../recipes/close-account.md).

### `pending_id`

If this transfer will post or void a pending transfer, `pending_id`
references that pending transfer. If this is not a post or void
transfer, it must be zero.

See the section on [Two-Phase Transfers](../design/two-phase-transfers.md) for more information on how the `pending_id` is used.

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* Must be zero if neither void nor pending transfer flag is set
* Must match an existing transfer's [`id`](#id) if non-zero

### `user_data_128`

This is an optional 128-bit secondary identifier to link this transfer to an
external entity or event.

As an example, you might use a [ULID](../design/data-modeling.md#time-based-identifiers)
that ties together a group of transfers.

For more information, see [Data Modeling](../design/data-modeling.md#user_data).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)

### `user_data_64`

This is an optional 64-bit secondary identifier to link this transfer to an
external entity or event.

As an example, you might use this field store an external timestamp.

For more information, see [Data Modeling](../design/data-modeling.md#user_data).

Constraints:

* Type is 64-bit unsigned integer (8 bytes)

### `user_data_32`

This is an optional 32-bit secondary identifier to link this transfer to an
external entity or event.

As an example, you might use this field to store a timezone or locale.

For more information, see [Data Modeling](../design/data-modeling.md#user_data).

Constraints:

* Type is 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)

### `timeout`

This is the interval in seconds after a
[`pending`](#flagspending) transfer's [arrival at the cluster](#timestamp)
that it may be posted or voided. Zero denotes absence of timeout.

If the timeout expires and the pending transfer has not already been
posted or voided, the pending transfer is voided automatically.

Non-pending transfers cannot have a timeout.

Constraints:

* Type is 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)
* Must be zero if `flags.pending` is *not* set

The `timeout` is an interval in seconds rather than an absolute timestamp
because this is more robust to clock skew between the cluster and the
application. (Watch this talk on
[Detecting Clock Sync Failure in Highly Available Systems](https://youtu.be/7R-Iz6sJG6Q?si=9sD2TpfD29AxUjOY)
on YouTube for more details.)

### `ledger`

This is an identifier that partitions the sets of accounts that can
transact with each other.

See [data modeling](../design/data-modeling.md#ledger) for more details
about how to think about setting up your ledgers.

Constraints:

* Type is 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `ledger` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `ledger`.
  * If `ledger` is nonzero, it must match the `ledger` value on the pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id` **and** `credit_account_id`.
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are not set:
  * `ledger` must not be zero.
  * `ledger` must match the `ledger` value on the accounts referenced in
    `debit_account_id` **and** `credit_account_id`.

### `code`

This is a user-defined enum denoting the reason for (or category of) the
transfer.

Constraints:

* Type is 16-bit unsigned integer (2 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `code` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `code`.
  * If `code` is nonzero, it must match the pending transfer's `code`.
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are not set, `code` must not
  be zero.

### `flags`

This specifies (optional) transfer behavior.

Constraints:

* Type is 16-bit unsigned integer (2 bytes)
* Some flags are mutually exclusive; see
  [`flags_are_mutually_exclusive`](./operations/create_transfers.md#flags_are_mutually_exclusive).

#### `flags.linked`

When the `linked` flag is specified, it links a transfer with the next
transfer in the batch, to create a chain of transfers, of arbitrary
length, which all succeed or fail in creation together. The tail of a
chain is denoted by the first transfer without this flag. The last
transfer in a batch may therefore never have `flags.linked` set as
this would leave a chain open-ended (see
[`linked_event_chain_open`](./operations/create_transfers.md#linked_event_chain_open)).

Multiple chains of individual transfers may coexist within a batch to
succeed or fail independently. Transfers within a chain are executed
within order, or are rolled back on error, so that the effect of each
transfer in the chain is visible to the next, and so that the chain is
either visible or invisible as a unit to subsequent transfers after the
chain. The transfer that was the first to break the chain will have a
unique error result. Other transfers in the chain will have their error
result set to
[`linked_event_failed`](./operations/create_transfers.md#linked_event_failed).

Consider this set of transfers as part of a batch:

| Transfer | Index within batch | flags.linked |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| `A`      | `0`                | `false`      |
| `B`      | `1`                | `true`       |
| `C`      | `2`                | `true`       |
| `D`      | `3`                | `false`      |
| `E`      | `4`                | `false`      |

If any of transfers `B`, `C`, or `D` fail (for example, due to
[`exceeds_credits`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exceeds_credits),
then `B`, `C`, and `D` will all fail. They are linked.

Transfers `A` and `E` fail or succeed independently of `B`, `C`, `D`,
and each other.

After the chain of linked transfers has executed, the fact that they were
linked will not be saved.
To save the association between transfers, it must be
[encoded into the data model](../design/data-modeling.md), for example by
adding an ID to one of the [user data](../design/data-modeling.md#user_data)
fields.

##### Examples

- [Currency Exchange](../recipes/currency-exchange.md)

#### `flags.pending`

Mark the transfer as a [pending transfer](../design/two-phase-transfers.md#reserve-funds-pending-transfer).

#### `flags.post_pending_transfer`

Mark the transfer as a [post-pending transfer](../design/two-phase-transfers.md#post-pending-transfer).

#### `flags.void_pending_transfer`

Mark the transfer as a [void-pending transfer](../design/two-phase-transfers.md#void-pending-transfer).

#### `flags.balancing_debit`

Transfer at most [`amount`](#amount) — automatically transferring less than `amount` as necessary
such that `debit_account.debits_pending + debit_account.debits_posted ≤ debit_account.credits_posted`.
If `amount` is set to `0`, transfer at most `2^64 - 1` (i.e. as much as possible).

If the highest amount transferable is `0`, returns
[`exceeds_credits`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exceeds_credits).

Retrying a balancing transfer will return
[`exists_with_different_amount`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exists_with_different_amount)
if the amount of the retry differs from the amount that was actually transferred.

The `amount` of the recorded transfer is set to the actual amount that was transferred, which is
less than or equal to the amount that was passed to `create_transfers`.

`flags.balancing_debit` is exclusive with the `flags.post_pending_transfer`/`flags.void_pending_transfer`
flags because posting or voiding a pending transfer will never exceed/overflow either account's limits.

`flags.balancing_debit` is compatible with (and orthogonal to) `flags.balancing_credit`.

##### Examples

- [Close Account](../recipes/close-account.md)

#### `flags.balancing_credit`

Transfer at most [`amount`](#amount) — automatically transferring less than `amount` as necessary
such that `credit_account.credits_pending + credit_account.credits_posted ≤ credit_account.debits_posted`.
If `amount` is set to `0`, transfer at most `2^64 - 1` (i.e. as much as possible).

If the highest amount transferable is `0`, returns
[`exceeds_debits`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exceeds_debits).

Retrying a balancing transfer will return
[`exists_with_different_amount`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exists_with_different_amount)
if the amount of the retry differs from the amount that was actually transferred.

The `amount` of the recorded transfer is set to the actual amount that was transferred, which is
less than or equal to the amount that was passed to `create_transfers`.

`flags.balancing_credit` is exclusive with the `flags.post_pending_transfer`/`flags.void_pending_transfer`
flags because posting or voiding a pending transfer will never exceed/overflow either account's limits.

`flags.balancing_credit` is compatible with (and orthogonal to) `flags.balancing_debit`.

##### Examples

- [Close Account](../recipes/close-account.md)

### `timestamp`

This is the time the transfer was created, as nanoseconds since
UNIX epoch.

It is set by TigerBeetle to the moment the transfer arrives at
the cluster.

You can read more about [Time in TigerBeetle](../design/time.md).

Constraints:

- Type is 64-bit unsigned integer (8 bytes)
- Must be set to `0` by the user when the `Transfer` is created
