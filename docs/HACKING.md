# Hacking on TigerBeetle

**Prerequisites:** The current beta version of TigerBeetle targets macOS and Linux and takes advantage of the latest asynchronous IO capabilities of the Linux kernel v5.6 and newer, via [io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf). As such it can only be used on macOS or on recent versions of Linux with an updated kernel.

## Setup

First grab the sources and run the setup script:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle.git
cd tigerbeetle
scripts/install.sh
```

## Benchmark

With TigerBeetle installed, you are ready to benchmark!

```console
./tigerbeetle benchmark
```

See comments at the top of [/src/tigerbeetle/benchmark_load.zig](/src/tigerbeetle/benchmark_load.zig)
for exactly what we're benchmarking.

*If you encounter any benchmark errors, please send us the resulting `benchmark.log`.*

## Running the Server

Launch a TigerBeetle cluster on your local machine by running each of these commands in a new terminal tab:

```console
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=3 0_0.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=1 --replica-count=3 0_1.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=2 --replica-count=3 0_2.tigerbeetle

./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3001,3002,3003 0_0.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3001,3002,3003 0_1.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3001,3002,3003 0_2.tigerbeetle
```

Run the TigerBeetle binary to see all command line arguments:

```console
./tigerbeetle --help
```

## Tests

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests:

```console
zig/zig build test
```

To run a single test by name:

```console
zig/zig build test:unit -- "name of test"
```

To run tests with code coverage (assuming `kcov` is installed on your system):

```console
COV=1 zig/zig build test
open kcov-output/index.html
```

The [Setup](#setup) step above will install Zig for you to the root of the `tigerbeetle` directory.

### Simulation Tests

To run TigerBeetle's long-running simulation, called *The VOPR*:

```console
zig/zig build vopr
```

Pass the `--send` flag to the VOPR to report discovered bugs to the [VOPR Hub](/src/vopr_hub/README.md). The VOPR Hub will automatically replay, deduplicate, and create GitHub issues as needed.

```console
zig/zig build vopr -- --send
```

Run the VOPR using a specific seed. This will run in `Debug` mode by default but you can also include `--build-mode` to run in ReleaseSafe mode.

```console
zig/zig build vopr -- --seed=123 --build-mode=ReleaseSafe
```

To view all the available command line arguments simply use the `--help` flag.

```console
zig/zig build vopr -- --help
```

*The VOPR* stands for *The Viewstamped Operation Replicator* and was inspired by the movie WarGames, by our love of fuzzing over the years, by [Dropbox's Nucleus testing](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine), and by [FoundationDB's deterministic simulation testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ).

*The VOPR* is [a deterministic simulator](/src/simulator.zig) that can fuzz many clusters of TigerBeetle servers and clients interacting through TigerBeetle's Viewstamped Replication consensus protocol, but all within a single developer machine process, with [a network simulator](/src/testing/packet_simulator.zig) to simulate all kinds of network faults, and with an in-memory [storage simulator](/src/testing/storage.zig) to simulate all kinds of storage faults, to explore and test TigerBeetle against huge state spaces in a short amount of time, by literally speeding up the passing of time within the simulation itself.

Beyond being a deterministic simulator, *The VOPR* also features [a state checker](/src/testing/cluster/state_checker.zig) that can hook into all the replicas, and check all their state transitions the instant they take place, using cryptographic hash chaining to prove causality and check that all interim state transitions are valid, based on any of the set of inflight client requests at the time, without divergent states, and then check for convergence to the highest state at the end of the simulation, to distinguish between correctness or liveness bugs.

## Hacking on Clients

Each client is built using language-specific tooling (`npm`, `maven`, `dotnet`, and `go`), and links
to a native library built with Zig. This is quite a zoo! To complicate things, some languages
trigger the native build automatically, while others require manually running `./zig/zig build
lang_client`.

See `client/$LANG/ci.zig` scripts for exact commands we use on CI to build clients.

### Testing Client Libraries

Each language client is tested by a mixture of unit-tests written using language-specific test
frameworks, and integration tests which run sample projects against a real `tigerbeetle` process.
Everything is orchestrated by [ci.zig](/src/scripts/ci.zig) script:

```console
./zig/zig build scripts -- ci --language=go
```
